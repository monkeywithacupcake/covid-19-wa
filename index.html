    <h4>Notes </h4>
    <ul>
      <li> The Case Fatality Rate is the number of reported deaths divided by the number of confirmed and reported cases. This number is useful for understanding reported deaths and cases but does not represent disease risk or mortality.</li>
      <li>County reporting for Negative, Pending, and Hospitalizations are inconsistent. I am starting to include them as data points where they are found.</li>
      <li>On 27 March, I started including "probable" cases as positive where they were reported. This caused jumps in a few county cases where the people in "presumed/probable" never moved to "confirmed". </li>
